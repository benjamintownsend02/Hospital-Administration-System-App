# Hospital Administrative System App Group Project #2

## Hospital Administrative System App

    Hospital Administrative System App is a medical record database used by doctors to create, update, and edit patient information on the go.

## Purpose

    The purpose of this application is to display our ability to utilize Express, MySQL, HandleBars, MySQL-CLI, and our understanding of routing, querying data, updating data, and utilizing the MVC file model. As a new package of technology we implemented express-basic-auth as a method to authenticate our logged in user. As a stretch goal we are planning to include an administrative portal to allow admins to manage Doctors.  

#### Getting Started

    Follow the link below to the deployed Heroku site. You can use the following credentials to login to our Patient care portal

            Username: admin
            Password:guest

                or

            Username:JDeer
            Password: 12345

    Once logged in you can search for a patient by patient id, name, and doctor Id. You can also add a new patient to the database. If you are unsure of what information to use in your search criteria, please follow the links at the bottom of the page to view information as it resides within the database.
